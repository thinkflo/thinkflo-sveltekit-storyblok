00:05.000 --> 00:08.500
But in this ever-changing landscape, 
there's a new approach that's changing the game.

Introducing JAMstack!

5
00:11.000 --> 00:14.500
In a traditional office, 
developers are hard at work on their web projects. 

6
00:14.500 --> 00:16.500
But they face numerous challenges. 

7
00:16.500 --> 00:21.500
Slow loading times, security vulnerabilities, 
and scalability issues hinder their progress.

8
00:22.000 --> 00:26.500
But wait! One developer has an idea. What if there was a better way?

9
00:26.500 --> 00:32.000

But on the right side, behold JAMstack, a streamlined and efficient process.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. Let's break it down.

12
00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
With JAMstack, the developer writes code, and it's instantly compiled into static HTML files. 

13
00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
